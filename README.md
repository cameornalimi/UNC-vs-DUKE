#### Aquiring The Data  
This data came from the [U.S. Department of Education](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/). The Department of Education showcases its equity in sports through data analysis. In this website, you will be able to find information on many universities and data pertaining to their sports teams. The website includes data on Sports Equity for most collegiate schools from 2003-2022. For this project I only downloaded the data for the year 2022. 

#### What Is The Data's Purpose? 
This repository has been made to provide a publicly accessible and reproducible dataset for those interested in eqiuity in athletics in U.S. universities. Our end goal is to create a subset of data that will answer the question: Does Football or Basketball produce more revenue when comparing UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University? Also, which sport totals more costs at those schools? This process can be reproduced with any level of expertise of Python. 

#### Potential Use
This is a repository containing instructional information on how use Python in Google Colab and the Pandas package to answer the following question: Does Football or Basketball have produce more revenue when comparing UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University in 2022? Also, which sport has more costs at those schools in 2022. I created this repository because I have a deep connection with the Duke and UNC rivalry. As a life long UNC sports fan and a current student, I am always trying to add on the reasons why UNC is better than Duke. But as the rivalry as gained much more hype spanning across decades, the success of both schools atheltically has maintained if not gotten better. With this, I wanted to see each school's cost and benefits from both of their biggest sports to get an idea of their current success. 

### Within this repository you will find three files. 

##### 1. A .csv file containing the original set of data that relates to college sports equity.
This .csv file contains many colleges and universities around the United States. It includes information like the university, total amount of players for a sport, the amount of coaches (female and male), revenue gained from each sport, etc.

##### 2. A Google Colab notebook 
Including steps on how to code in Colab with the Pandaas package to create a subset of the original set of data.

##### 3. Two .csv files containing the subset of data from the original .csv file.
These two smaller .csv files will include the cost and revenue for both UNC's and Duke's basketball and football programs.

#### Main Women Sports Results

The visuzaltion shown was produced through [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/). Taking the top collegiete sports, this displays how many women are in those sports. To do this we had to manually crunch the numbers for each of these five sports.
